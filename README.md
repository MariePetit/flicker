# üî• What is Flicker? üî•

Flicker is a web app designed to help you keep track of movies or shows you want to watch or have watched. To get started, set up your account and start browsing through our site!

However, what makes Flicker so special is the possibility of linking your account with your significant other or BFF. Once you are Flicker Partners, any movies or shows you are both interested in will be added to a joint watchlist you can each access. No more browsing for endless hours on a streaming app, looking for something your both want to watch!

_Note_: This app is still in early development, and there are many more features to come, so make sure you keep a lookout for upcoming updates!

## What can you do on Flicker at this time?

As part of Flicker's launch, here are our current functionalities:

### `Add to personal or joint watchlist`

To make it extra easy for you on managing your watchlists, we do all the work in the background. All you have to do is click the ‚ù§Ô∏è heart ‚ù§Ô∏è on the item card, and our algorithm will verify a few things:

- If this movie/TV show is already in your personal watchlist, it will remove it from it (simply put, you're no longer interested in watching it).
- If it isn't already in your personal watchlist, it will check if your account is linked with someone, and if so, check if this movie is in `their` watchlist. If it is, then you guys are `flickering` and the item is added to both your joint watchlist. As a bonus, we're also taking it out of their personal watchlist - that way, they can't use the excuse "Oh, I didn't know you wanted to watch it... so I watched it without you!".
- If you have no one you're flickering with, then it simply gets added to your personal watchlist.

The best part is... all you have to do is click and unclick the ‚ù§Ô∏è for the magic to happen!

### `Add to favorites`

A cool feature is the possibility to mark which movies or TV shows you _really_ liked. It's pretty straightforward - just click the ‚≠ê! This will show up on your profile page where your Flicker partner can take a peek and plan you the best movie night when you need it!

### `What if I already watched that?`

You've already watched this movie? Well, just click on the üëÄ to keep track of what you've already watched! Added bonus - you can then select whether you liked it or not by clicking the üëç or üëé that will magically appear!

### `Browsing movies or TV shows`

Browse our database of 100 movies or TV shows by simply navigating to the appropriate tab. You can select a specific genre at the top of the list to help filter your search! Moreover, clicking on a movie or TV show card will take you a more detailed page, with a wide variety of information, like the year of release, all the tagged genres, a synopsis of the movie and the top cast!

### `Your profile page`

Your profile page was designed to reflect your flickering interests! It will show you (and your Flicker Partner if you have one) what you've added as favorites, the movie/TV show you've most recently watched, and the last 5 movies/TV shows you liked! And guess what? You can see that same information for your Flicker Partner too!

## Features in the works

As previously mentioned, this app is still in early development and there are many more features that will be added in the near-future. Check out some of ideas below!

### Choosing more than one Flicker Partner

At this time, you can only link your account with one other Flicker Partner. But what if you wanted to create a group watchlist with some friends or family? A group account would make that possible!

### Customizing Your Profile Page

As part of an upcoming update, we will give you the opportunity to make your profile page really _you_, by giving you the possibility of editing your banner and profile photo, and also with a small bio section.

### Adding a show tracker

A show tracker is a game changer. Being able to track which TV shows you're watching and which episode you're at is one of the most important features we're working on right now!

### Google Authentication

A simple feature but one of the most time-saving one. Why waste time logging into your account or taking a lot of time creating one when you could be spending it watching something fun?

### Even More Details!

The information we're extracting for each movie or TV show at this time is limited as we opted for quality over quantity for the launch. However, we will be adding many more features, such as related suggestions, ratings, etc.!

## Thank you for being a üî• Flicker üî• ~ you light up our world!
